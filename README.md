### Website Essentials
* This is a clothing website design for women who wanted a simple and stylish look. It is designed with a black and white streamline look. It has a simple layout that is easy to navitgate.

* The first goal was to create the homepage using HTML and CSS. It need to include: straightforward logical web structure, responsive web design, prominent navigation bar, consistent theme, images, social media links, footer, contact info for the store, and customer testimonials. 

* After that was completed, I created my first modal for a product quick look. (Floral Maxi Dress-featured in the 'Shop the Latest Looks' section)
